# This file is used to configure build-time settings that should NOT be
# committed to version control. The actual local.properties file is already
# in .gitignore.
#
# Copy this file to 'local.properties' and fill in your values.

# OpenAI API Key for testing
# This key will be embedded in the build and automatically loaded on first app launch.

# Example:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890
